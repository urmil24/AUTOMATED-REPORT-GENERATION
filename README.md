# DESCRIPTION OF TASK 

# AUTOMATED REPORT GENERATION

**Project Overview**

**AUTOMATED REPORT GENERATION** is a data-driven Python project that reads structured data from a CSV file, analyzes it, visualizes patterns, and automatically generates a clean and formatted PDF report. This 
project simulates real-world reporting workflows often seen in business intelligence (BI), stock market analytics, and performance monitoring domains. Using open-source libraries such as  **Pandas** , 
**Matplotlib**, and **FPDF**, the script processes raw stock data, creates statistical summaries and charts, and compiles everything into a structured PDF document.The key goal of the project is to **automate 
repetitive data reporting tasks** — turning raw data into insightful, human-readable documentation without manual effort.

**Project Objective**

DEVELOP A SCRIPT THAT READS DATA FROM A FILE, ANALYZES IT, AND GENERATES A FORMATTED PDF REPORT USING LIBRARIES LIKE FPDF OR REPORTLAB.

**Tools & Technologies Used**

1) *Python 3* Core programming language
2) *Pandas* Data loading, cleaning, and statistical analysis 
3) *Matplotlib* Visualizing stock price trends and volume 
4) *FPDF* Generating multi-page PDF reports 
5) *KaggleHub*  Fetching real-world datasets from Kaggle 
6) *Google Colab*  Cloud-based code editor for development and execution 

 **Workflow**

*Step 1: Load Real-World Data*
The script uses `kagglehub` to load real stock market data (`AAPL.csv`) from a public Kaggle dataset. The data contains stock prices, trading volume, and other financial indicators.

*Step 2: Data Preprocessing*
The `Date` column is converted to datetime format, the dataset is sorted chronologically, and moving averages (20-day and 50-day) are calculated to reveal stock trends.

*Step 3: Data Analysis*
Using `Pandas`, the following analytics are generated:
- Average closing price
- Maximum and minimum prices
- Latest trading date and closing price
- Total volume traded

*Step 4: Data Visualization*
Two charts are created using `Matplotlib`:
- A line chart of the stock’s closing price with 20-day and 50-day moving averages
- A bar chart of trading volumes over the last 10 days

*Step 5: PDF Report Generation*
A class-based wrapper around the `FPDF` library is used to:
- Add titles and headings
- Insert statistical insights
- Embed charts
- Display tabular summaries of the last 10 days

Finally, the report is exported as a `.pdf` file.

**Applicability**

This project has broad use cases in:
*Financial and stock market analysis*
*Business reporting and performance dashboards*
*Healthcare reporting (e.g., patient trends, diagnostics)*
*Corporate analytics and executive summaries*
*Academic and research publication tools*
*Automated audit and compliance documentation*

Automating report generation saves significant manual effort, especially in fields where daily/weekly/monthly reports are essential.

**Code Editor Used**

This project was entirely developed and tested on **Google Colab**, a free, cloud-hosted Jupyter notebook environment provided by Google. Colab is ideal for rapid prototyping, data science workflows, and automation scripts.

Key benefits of using Google Colab:
- No local setup required
- Free access to GPUs and TPUs (if needed)
- Easy sharing and collaboration
- Integration with Google Drive

**Final Thoughts**

With minimal code, this project automates a task often done manually in organizations. Whether you're working with **stock data, sales reports, or scientific experiments**, this kind of automation can save hours of manual work every week.

By combining **data analysis, visualization, and report generation**, this project demonstrates the power of Python in modern-day business automation and data storytelling.

**Future Improvements**

- Integrate with APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) for live data
- Allow user to select custom stocks or time periods
- Add email automation to send reports
- Export to HTML and Word formats as well
